<h1>
  Welcome to my Website :3
</h1>

<p>
  Hey everyone! c: <br>
  My name is Kate A.K.A. CyberKate and I&apos;d like to thank you for visiting my website!
  Please don&apos;t critique me too hard, I am BRAND NEW at this!!<br>
  My goal is to learn web developing so I can get a job & afford to go to college for Computer Engineering!
  I sorta made this website to be used as a portfolio (coming soon lol) but for now it will
  just be my little playground. That way I can use this as a practice project! I'm also going to use
  this as a blog, so I can vent a little about my life, and for anyone interested in getting to know me! (:
</p>

<h1>
  About Me
</h1>

<p>
  My name's Kate, just turned 20, born in Florida, but I currently live in California (:
</p>

<p>
  My life story isn&apos;t anything to brag about, but I&apos;ve been doing the best I can! 
  To spare you some details, my home life was never very healthy and I was forced to move out when I turned 18.
  Ever since then, I&apos;ve been very poor.. living paycheck to paycheck.
  I&apos;ve tried getting a decent paying job, but I suffer from chronic daily migraines AND I don&apos;t have health insurance :/
  so I can&apos;t even afford medication, even if I was able to see my doctor. I&apos;ve been moving from job to job, trying to keep my
  head above water, but I always end up getting let go because I have to call out so much due to my migraines.
  The only hope I have is the money I make from video editing (IYKUK), but even doing that is difficult to do with my poopy laptop.
  I&apos;m going to set up a way to donate, for any of you generous enough to do so.. 
  I just want to be able to afford to buy a PC and go to college. Any amount of help I receive will be greatly appreciated.
  If not, sit back and hang out with me (: it&apos;s free!
